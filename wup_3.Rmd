```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
require(tidyverse)
require(tigerstats)
davisdata <- read.csv(file="UCDavis.csv")
```
## Our Goal is to answer this question Is there a difference between the alcohol consumed between the row
## you choose to sit in??
```{r eval=FALSE}
davisdata <- davisdata %>%
mutate(across(where(is.character), as.factor))
```
## Now with ggplot - first select the basic data

```{r}
basicCN <- ggplot(davisdata,aes(y=alcohol,x=Seat))
```
## Now add in boxplot

```{r}
basicCN + geom_boxplot()
```
  
  As we can see in the boxplot, the people who sit in the back consume more alcohol than the people who sit in the middle and the front. The median of the front is at 0, while the median of the middle is around 1 or 2, and the median of the back is around 4 or 5. From looking at the medians, we can see the back has the most students averaged to consume alcohol. 

## Numerical Summarys 
```{r}
favstats(alcohol~Seat,data=davisdata)
```

As we can see through this data, the mean of front is 1.8, the middle is 3.28, and the back is 9.6. This shows us the back has a larger mean than the front and the middle which means the back has larger alcohol consumption.
